   The invention discloses a carbon fiber solar panel car roof. Carbon fiber is taken as a raw
material to be subjected to die machining; one or more required carbon fiber car roof models are formed;
then a silicon raw material is subjected to chemical vapor deposition or deposited or sprayed on
to a prepared carbon fiber model base in a physical spraying mode in a reaction chamber, so as to
form a crystalline silicon film; finally the carbon fiber model base with the crystalline silicon
film is put into a crystal oven, so as to be subjected to high-temperature melting crystallization;
 and a series of battery piece manufacture processes are performed, so that a required solar panel
 is obtained, and the finished product of the carbon fiber solar panel car roof is - obtained
